# Dev Rando Challenge Submissions

## Welcome to Dev Rando!

This repository is dedicated to issues/submissions for the Dev Rando project. Dev Rando is a unique coding challenge that randomizes NPM dependencies, pushing developers to think creatively and build projects with unexpected constraints.

## How It Works

1. **Get Your Challenge**: Visit [Dev Rando](https://dev-rando.vercel.app/) to receive your randomized package.json.
2. **Build Your Project**: Create a new project using the provided locked dependencies. Your goal is to make something interesting that works!
3. **Submit Your Creation**: Once you've completed your project, submit it here by creating a new issue. In the future, projects published on GitHub with devrando metadata will be automatically featured on the site.

Happy coding!
